# UX Writing Benchmarks & Research-Backed Metrics

Research-validated benchmarks for creating effective interface copy.

## Sentence Length & Comprehension

### Comprehension Rates by Word Count

Based on readability research:

- **8 words or fewer**: 100% user comprehension
- **14 words or fewer**: 90% user comprehension
- **20 words**: 80% user comprehension
- **25 words**: Maximum before significant comprehension drop
- **30+ words**: Comprehension drops below 60%

### Recommended Sentence Lengths by Content Type

**Critical Content (errors, warnings, confirmations):**

- Target: 8-14 words maximum

- Example: "Delete account? You'll lose all data and this can't be undone." (12 words - 90% comprehension)

**Instructions & Guidance:**

- Target: 14 words ideal, 20 words maximum
- Why: Clear step-by-step requires brevity
- Example: "Connect your bank to see spending insights. We'll guide you through it." (13 words)

**Body/Explanatory Text:**

## Character & Line Length

### Optimal Reading Line Length

**Research-backed range: 40-60 characters per line**

**Why it matters:**

## Active vs. Passive Voice

### Target: 85% Active Voice

**Why it matters:**

- Active voice is clearer and more engaging
- Passive voice adds words and obscures responsibility
- Active voice feels more conversational and human

**Examples:**

| Passive (Wordy & Unclear)         | Active (Clear & Concise)    | Words Saved |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| "Your payment has been processed" | "We processed your payment" | 1 word      |
| "Your request has been received"  | "We received your request"  | 1 word      |
| "An error has occurred"           | "We found an error"         | 1 word      |
| "Your file is being uploaded"     | "We're uploading your file" | 1 word      |

**When passive voice is acceptable:**

- When actor is unknown: "Your session expired" (vs unclear "We expired your session")
- When action is more important than actor: "File deleted" (vs "You deleted the file")
- When avoiding blame: "Payment declined" (vs "Your bank declined payment")

## Accessibility Benchmarks

### WCAG Compliance

**WCAG Level AA Requirements for Text:**

- Color contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold)
- Text alternatives: All images and icons have text equivalents
- Link text: Descriptive (not "click here")
- Form labels: Present and programmatically associated
- Error identification: Text description (not color alone)

### Cognitive Accessibility

**Sentence length for maximum accessibility:**

- **8-14 words**: Optimal for users with cognitive disabilities
- **Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences maximum**
- **Use headings every 3-4 paragraphs**

**Plain language requirements:**

- Define abbreviations on first use
- Avoid idioms and metaphors
- Use common words over complex ones
- Provide explanations for technical terms

---

## Mobile vs. Desktop Considerations

### Mobile-Specific Benchmarks

**Character limits (tighter due to screen size):**

- Button labels: 12-18 characters (vs 25 desktop)
- Page titles: 25-35 characters (vs 50 desktop)
- Notification text: 60-100 characters (vs 180 desktop)

**Word counts (same or fewer):**

- Follow desktop benchmarks or go shorter
- Mobile users scan even faster
- Thumb-friendly tap targets need brief labels

**Line length (narrower):**

- Target: 30-50 characters per line
- Mobile screens naturally constrain line length
- Avoid artificially wide text blocks
