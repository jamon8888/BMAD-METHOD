# The Four Quality Standards Framework

A comprehensive framework for evaluating and creating effective UX text based on four measurable quality standards.

## Overview

The Four Quality Standards provide an objective, research-backed framework for UX writing. Every piece of interface copy should be evaluated against these standards:

1. **Purposeful** - Helps users or the business achieve goals
2. **Concise** - Uses the fewest words possible without losing meaning
3. **Conversational** - Sounds natural and human, not robotic
4. **Clear** - Unambiguous, accurate, and easy to understand

## 1. Purposeful

### Definition

Text that helps users accomplish their goals or advances business objectives. Every word should have a clear purpose.

### Evaluation Questions

- Does this help the user accomplish their goal?
- Does it serve a business objective?
- Is the value to the user clear?
- Are user concerns anticipated and addressed?
- Does it answer the question "What's in it for me?"

### Scoring Rubric (0-10)

**9-10: Excellent**

- Clear, immediate user benefit
- Anticipates and addresses user concerns
- Advances both user and business goals
- Value proposition is explicit

**7-8: Good**

- User benefit present but could be more prominent
- Addresses most user concerns
- Serves goals but could be more targeted

**5-6: Adequate**

- Some user benefit
- Generic value proposition
- Doesn't fully address user concerns

**3-4: Needs Work**

- Unclear purpose
- Doesn't obviously help user
- System-focused rather than user-focused

**1-2: Poor**

- No discernible user benefit
- Creates confusion about purpose
- Purely system/business focused

**0: Unacceptable**

- Actively hinders user goals
- No apparent purpose

### Examples

**Low Purposeful (3/10):**
"Click here"

- What happens when I click?
- Why should I click?
- Where does it lead?

**High Purposeful (9/10):**
"Download pricing guide"

- Clear action (download)
- Clear benefit (get pricing info)
- Specific object (the guide)

---

## 2. Concise

### Definition

Uses the minimum number of words needed to convey meaning clearly. Every word must earn its place.

### Evaluation Questions

- Can any words be removed without losing meaning?
- Is information front-loaded (most important first)?
- Does every word earn its space?
- Could this be shorter and still clear?
- Are there redundant phrases?

### Research-Backed Benchmarks

**By UI Element:**

- **Buttons/CTAs**: 2-4 words ideal, 6 word maximum
- **Titles**: 3-6 words, 40 characters maximum
- **Error messages**: 12-18 words (including solution)
- **Instructions**: 20 words maximum, 14 ideal
- **Body copy**: 15-20 words per sentence average
- **Notifications**: 10-15 words for title + body

**Comprehension Rates:**

- 8 words or fewer: 100% user comprehension
- 14 words or fewer: 90% user comprehension
- 25 words: Maximum before significant drop

**Character & Line Length:**

- Line length: 40-60 characters for maximum readability
- Button labels: 15-25 characters
- Page titles: 30-50 characters
- Notification titles: 35-45 characters

### Scoring Rubric (0-10)

**9-10: Excellent**

- No wasted words
- Perfectly concise for the pattern
- Meets or beats benchmark
- Front-loaded key information

**7-8: Good**

- Generally concise
- Minor redundancies
- Close to benchmark
- Mostly front-loaded

**5-6: Adequate**

- Some unnecessary words
- Could be tighter
- Slightly over benchmark
- Some buried information

**3-4: Needs Work**

- Verbose
- Significant redundancies
- Well over benchmark
- Key info buried

**1-2: Poor**

- Extremely wordy
- Many unnecessary phrases
- Far exceeds benchmarks
- Difficult to scan

**0: Unacceptable**

- Incomprehensibly verbose

### Examples

**Low Concise (4/10):**
"Please be advised that your request has been received and is currently being processed by our team." (17 words)

- "Please be advised that" = 4 wasted words
- "currently being" = unnecessary qualifiers
- Passive voice adds words

**High Concise (9/10):**
"We're processing your request." (4 words)

- Active voice
- No wasted words
- Clear and direct
- 76% shorter

---

## 3. Conversational

### Definition

Sounds natural and human, as if you're speaking directly to someone. Not robotic or overly formal.

### Evaluation Questions

- Would you actually say this out loud?
- Does it use active voice?
- Are there natural connecting words (prepositions, articles)?
- Is it free of corporate jargon and buzzwords?
- Does it feel human?

### Guidelines

**Active vs. Passive Voice:**

- Target: 85% active voice
- Active: "We sent your email" (clear actor)
- Passive: "Your email has been sent" (no clear actor)

**Natural Language Indicators:**

- Includes articles (a, an, the)
- Includes prepositions (to, from, with)
- Uses contractions appropriately (we'll, you're, can't)
- Avoids formal constructions ("kindly", "please be advised")

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

- "An error has occurred"
- "Your request has been received"
- "Please be advised that"
- "Kindly note that"
- "We are pleased to inform you"

### Scoring Rubric (0-10)

**9-10: Excellent**

- Completely natural
- Would say this in person
- Active voice throughout
- Human and warm

**7-8: Good**

- Mostly natural
- Minor stiffness
- Mostly active voice
- Generally conversational

**5-6: Adequate**

- Some natural elements
- Mix of active/passive
- Some corporate phrases
- Readable but not warm

**3-4: Needs Work**

- Stiff and formal
- Heavy passive voice
- Corporate jargon
- Robotic tone

**1-2: Poor**

- Extremely robotic
- All passive voice
- Heavy jargon
- Unnatural phrasing

**0: Unacceptable**

- Incomprehensible jargon

### Examples

**Low Conversational (3/10):**
"Your payment transaction has been successfully processed and a confirmation has been sent to your registered email address."

- All passive voice
- Formal, robotic
- Wouldn't say this aloud
- Corporate tone

**High Conversational (9/10):**
"Payment complete. We sent a confirmation to your email."

- Active voice ("we sent")
- Natural, direct
- How you'd actually speak
- Human tone

## 4. Clear

### Definition

Unambiguous and easy to understand. Uses specific language that's accessible to the target audience.

### Evaluation Questions

- Is there only one way to interpret this?
- Are verbs specific and meaningful?
- Is terminology consistent with the product?
- Does it meet readability targets?
- Could it be misunderstood?

### Reading Level Guidelines

**By Audience:**

- **General public**: 7th-8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid)
- **Professional tools**: 9th-10th grade
- **Technical products**: 10th-11th grade
- **Specialized fields**: 11th-12th grade (only when necessary)

**Testing Tools:**

- Hemingway Editor: Highlights complex sentences
- Readable.com: Multiple readability scores
- Microsoft Word: Built-in Flesch-Kincaid scoring

### Clarity Best Practices

**Use Specific Verbs:**

- ❌ Generic: "Process", "Handle", "Manage"

**Avoid Ambiguity:**

- ❌ "Update soon" (when?)
- ✅ "Update in 5 minutes"
- ❌ "Several items" (how many?)
- ✅ "3 items"

**Plain Language:**

- Use common words over complex ones
- ❌ "Utilize" → ✅ "Use"
- ❌ "Terminate" → ✅ "End"
- ❌ "Purchase" → ✅ "Buy"

**Consistent Terminology:**

- Pick one term and stick with it
- Don't alternate between "remove" and "delete"
- Don't switch between "save" and "submit"

- High reading level

**High Clear (9/10):**
"Complete your purchase now."

- "Complete" = specific action
- "Purchase" = clear object
- "Now" = clear timing
- Simple, direct language

## Applying the Framework

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Draft the text**

- Start with conversation: what would you say?
- Don't worry about perfection yet

**2. Edit for Purposeful**

- Is user benefit clear?
- Are concerns addressed?
- Does it advance goals?

**3. Edit for Concise**

- Remove unnecessary words
- Front-load key information
- Check against benchmarks

**4. Edit for Conversational**

- Read aloud: would you say this?
- Convert passive to active
- Remove corporate speak

**5. Edit for Clear**

- Use specific verbs
- Check reading level
- Eliminate ambiguity

**6. Score and validate**

- Score each standard 0-10
- Average for overall score
- Target: 8+ overall

### Overall Scoring

**Calculate Average:**
(Purposeful + Concise + Conversational + Clear) ÷ 4 = Overall Score

**Quality Benchmarks:**

- **9-10**: Excellent - Ship it
- **8-8.9**: Very Good - Minor tweaks only
- **7-7.9**: Good - Consider improvements
- **6-6.9**: Adequate - Needs work
- **Below 6**: Poor - Requires significant revision

### When Standards Conflict

Sometimes improving one standard slightly reduces another. Prioritize based on context:

**High-stakes actions (delete, payment):**

- Prioritize: Clear > Purposeful > Concise > Conversational
- Better to be thorough than brief

**Routine actions (save, send):**

- Prioritize: Concise > Clear > Conversational > Purposeful
- Users want efficiency

**First-time use:**

- Prioritize: Purposeful > Clear > Conversational > Concise
- Users need guidance

**Error states:**

- Prioritize: Purposeful > Conversational > Clear > Concise
- Users need empathy and solutions

## Common Patterns & Expected Scores
