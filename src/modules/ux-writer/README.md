## Overview

The UX Writer module transforms interface copy creation with a systematic, evidence-based approach. Based on the [ux-writing-skill](https://github.com/content-designer/ux-writing-skill) by Christopher Greer (Stripe Staff Content Designer), this module brings UX writing best practices into the BMad Method framework.

### What is UX Writing?

UX writing (also called microcopy or interface copy) is the text users see and interact with in digital products:

- Buttons and links
- Error messages and warnings
- Success confirmations
- Empty states
- Form labels and instructions
- Notifications and alerts
- Onboarding flows
- Help text and tooltips

Good UX writing helps users accomplish their goals quickly and confidently.

## The Four Quality Standards

Every piece of interface copy is evaluated against four measurable standards:

### 1. **Purposeful** (Helps users/business achieve goals)

- Clear user benefit
- Addresses user concerns
- Advances objectives
- **Example:** "Download pricing guide" (clear action + benefit) vs. "Click here" (vague)

### 2. **Concise** (Fewest words without losing meaning)

- No wasted words
- Front-loaded information
- Meets research benchmarks
- **Example:** "We're processing your request" (4 words) vs. "Your request has been received and is currently being processed" (10 words)

### 3. **Conversational** (Natural and human, not robotic)

- Active voice (85% target)
- Natural language
- Human tone
- **Example:** "We couldn't save your changes" (natural) vs. "An error has occurred" (robotic)

### 4. **Clear** (Unambiguous and easy to understand)

- Specific verbs
- Appropriate reading level
- Consistent terminology
- **Example:** "Email must include @" (specific) vs. "Invalid email" (vague)

### Scoring System

Each standard is scored 0-10:

- **9-10**: Excellent - Ship it
- **8-8.9**: Very Good - Minor tweaks only
- **7-7.9**: Good - Consider improvements
- **6-6.9**: Adequate - Needs work
- **Below 6**: Poor - Requires significant revision

**Overall Score** = Average of all four standards

## Best Practices

### For All Interface Copy

1. **Start with Purpose** - What should the user understand or do?
2. **Front-Load Key Info** - Most important words first
3. **Read Aloud** - If it sounds awkward, it likely is
4. **Check Benchmarks** - Word count, character limits, reading level
5. **Test Comprehension** - Can user understand in 2 seconds?

### Pattern-Specific Guidelines

**Buttons:**

- Use imperative verb + object: "Save changes" not "Save"
- Be specific: "Delete account" not "Delete"
- Avoid generic labels: Never "OK", "Submit", "Click here"

**Error Messages:**

- Never blame user: "Email must include @" not "Invalid email"
- Include solution: "Check your connection and try again"
- Be empathetic: "We couldn't process..." not "An error occurred"

**Success Messages:**

- Past tense: "Changes saved" not "Saving changes"
- Specific action: "Email sent" not "Success!"
- Proportional: Brief for small actions, detailed for big ones

**Empty States:**

- Explain why empty: "No messages yet"
- Provide clear CTA: "Start a conversation"
- Use encouraging tone: "yet" implies future value

**Form Fields:**

- Label describes input: "Email address" not "Enter email"
- Instructions explain why: "We'll send updates to this email"
- Placeholder sparingly: Only for format examples

### Accessibility Best Practices

1. **Screen Readers** - Label all interactive elements descriptively
2. **Plain Language** - Target 7th-8th grade reading level
3. **Visual Independence** - Don't rely on color alone
4. **Cognitive Load** - Keep critical content to 8-14 words
5. **Consistent Patterns** - Reduce memory load with consistency

### Tone Adaptation

Adjust tone based on user emotional state:

**Frustrated** (errors, failures)

- Empathetic and solution-focused
- Acknowledge problem without blame
- Example: "Payment failed. Check your card and try again."

**Confused** (first use, complex features)

- Patient and explanatory
- Break down steps clearly
- Example: "Connect your bank to see insights. We'll guide you."

**Confident** (routine tasks)

- Efficient and direct
- Minimal explanation
- Example: "Saved"

**Cautious** (high-stakes actions)

- Serious and transparent
- Clear consequences
- Example: "Delete account? You'll lose all data. This can't be undone."

**Successful** (completions)

- Positive and encouraging
- Proportional celebration
- Example: "Profile updated. Your changes are live."
