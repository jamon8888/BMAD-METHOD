# Improve UX Text Task

Transform existing interface copy using the Four Quality Standards framework with before/after comparison and detailed scoring.

## Task Overview

This task takes existing UX text and improves it through systematic application of the Four Quality Standards: Purposeful, Concise, Conversational, and Clear.

## Elicitation Process

### 1. Get Original Text

```
Please share the interface text you want to improve.
```

### 2. Gather Context

```
Help me understand:

1. What type of UI element is this? (button, error, notification, etc.)
2. What is the user trying to do when they see this?
3. Where does this appear in your product?
4. What is the user's likely emotional state?
5. Are there any constraints? (character limits, technical requirements, brand guidelines)
```

### 3. Identify Priorities

```
What's most important to improve?

1. Make it more helpful/purposeful
2. Make it more concise
3. Make it sound more natural/human
4. Make it clearer/easier to understand
5. All of the above

(This helps prioritize if there are tradeoffs)
```

## Improvement Process

### Step 1: Analyze Original

Score the original text against four standards (0-10 each):

**Purposeful:**

- Does it help user achieve goals?
- Is value clear?
- Are concerns addressed?

**Concise:**

- Word count vs. benchmarks
- Unnecessary words?
- Front-loaded?

**Conversational:**

- Natural language?
- Active voice?
- Human tone?

**Clear:**

- Unambiguous?
- Specific verbs?
- Appropriate reading level?

### Step 2: Identify Issues

Common problems to look for:

**Purposeful issues:**

- Generic/vague purpose
- Doesn't help user progress
- Missing user benefit
- Doesn't address concerns

**Concise issues:**

- Redundant words ("please note that...")
- Passive constructions ("your request has been received")
- Unnecessary qualifiers ("very", "quite", "really")
- Buried key information

**Conversational issues:**

- Robotic phrases ("an error has occurred")
- Excessive passive voice
- Corporate jargon
- Missing natural connectors

**Clear issues:**

- Ambiguous language
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Generic verbs ("handle", "process")
- High reading level
- Inconsistent terminology

### Step 3: Apply Improvements

**For Purposeful:**

1. Front-load user benefit
2. Add missing context
3. Anticipate questions
4. Make value explicit

**For Concise:**

1. Remove qualifier words
2. Combine redundant phrases
3. Use shorter alternative words
4. Eliminate unnecessary preambles

**For Conversational:**

1. Convert passive to active voice
2. Replace robotic phrases with natural language
3. Write how you'd say it aloud
4. Add contractions where appropriate

**For Clear:**

1. Replace generic verbs with specific ones
2. Simplify complex words
3. Break long sentences
4. Add concrete details

### Step 4: Validate Improvements

Check improved version:

- [ ] Scores higher on all four standards
- [ ] Meets accessibility requirements
- [ ] Follows pattern best practices
- [ ] Respects any constraints
- [ ] Maintains appropriate tone
