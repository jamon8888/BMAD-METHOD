# Deep Research Workflow

**Universal AI Research - Works with ANY model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)**

## Overview

The Deep Research workflow implements a model-agnostic enterprise-grade research system. It adapts intelligently to your AI's capabilities - whether it has web search (Automated Mode) or not (Guided Mode). Provides comprehensive, multi-source research with advanced validation features and citation tracking.

## Features

- **Model-Agnostic**: Works with ALL AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
- **3 Operational Modes**: Automated (with web search), Guided (without), Hybrid
- **8-Phase Research Pipeline**: Scope → Plan → Gather → Triangulate → Synthesize → Critique → Refine → Package
- **4 Research Modes**: Quick, Standard, Deep, and UltraDeep for different needs
- **Citation Validation**: CiteGuard system prevents hallucinated sources
- **Source Credibility Assessment**: Evaluate authority, recency, methodology, and bias
- **Intelligent Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts to available capabilities
- **Progressive Assembly**: Handle unlimited report length

## Usage

### Automated Mode (With Web Search)

For Claude Code, ChatGPT Plus, Gemini with search:

```
agent deep-research/research-specialist

*research             # Standard mode (auto web research)
*quick-research       # Quick mode (fast auto research)
*deep-research        # Deep mode (extensive verification)
*ultra-research       # Ultra-deep mode (maximum rigor)
```

### Guided Mode (Without Web Search)

For standard ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini:

1. Load the agent and workflow instructions
2. Request research - AI will guide you to find sources
3. Provide sources as requested
4. AI synthesizes everything into professional report

Example:

```
User: Research quantum computing trends
AI: I'll guide you through research in Guided Mode...
    Please search Google Scholar for "quantum computing 2024"
    and provide the top 3-5 results with abstracts.
User: [Provides sources]
AI: Perfect! Now let's check industry reports...
    [Continues guiding until sufficient sources]
AI: [Produces comprehensive research report with citations]
```

### Direct Workflow

```bash
workflow deep-research/research --data=/path/to/context.md
```

### With Research Context

Create a context file specifying:

- Research question
- Specific angles of interest
- Target audience
- Time/depth preferences

## Research Modes

| Mode          | Duration   | Sources | Verification            | Best For            |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Quick**     | 2-5 min    | 2-5     | Basic fact-checking     | Initial exploration |
| **Standard**  | 5-10 min   | 15-30   | Multi-source comparison | Most research needs |
| **Deep**      | 10-20 min  | 30+     | 3+ sources per claim    | Important decisions |
| **UltraDeep** | 20-45+ min | 50+     | Maximum rigor           | Enterprise analysis |

## Quality Standards

### Citations

- Every factual claim must cite a specific source immediately
- Format: "According to [1], finding..."
- No vague attributions like "studies show"
- Complete bibliography (no truncation)

### Source Diversity

- Minimum 10+ distinct sources (Standard mode)
- Multiple source types: academic, industry, news, official data
- Credibility assessment for each source
- Bias evaluation and documentation

### Verification

- Major claims: 3+ source verification
- Statistics: Cross-checked across sources
- Contradictions: Documented and analyzed
- Confidence levels: Explicitly stated

## Output Structure

Reports include:

- **Executive Summary** (under 250 words)
- **Introduction** (scope, methodology, context)
- **Main Findings** (themed sections with citations)
- **Synthesis & Analysis** (patterns and implications)
- **Limitations & Gaps** (explicit acknowledgment)
- **Recommendations** (actionable insights)
- **Complete Bibliography** (all sources cited)
- **Methodology Appendix** (process transparency)

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general searches, narrow based on findings
2. **Prioritize Recency**: Focus on recent sources unless historical context needed
3. **Cross-Reference**: Verify statistics across multiple sources
4. **Assess Credibility**: Evaluate author/publisher authority and bias
5. **Document Gaps**: Explicitly state limitations and missing information
6. **Cite Immediately**: Add citations right after claims
7. **Save Progress**: Use incremental file writing for long reports

## Anti-Hallucination Safeguards

1. No citation without actual source
2. Explicit attribution with source names
3. Complete bibliography entries
4. Confidence level markers
5. Explicit gap acknowledgment

## Example Research Questions

- "What are the latest trends in quantum computing commercialization?"
- "Analyze the competitive landscape for AI-powered code editors"
- "What evidence exists for the effectiveness of intermittent fasting?"
- "How has remote work impacted software development productivity?"
- "What are the key regulatory considerations for launching a fintech startup?"
