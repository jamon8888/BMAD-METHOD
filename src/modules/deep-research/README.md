| **ChatGPT Plus** (with browsing) | Automated | Full web search + real-time research     |
| **Gemini** (with search)         | Automated | Full web search + real-time research     |
| **ChatGPT** (standard)           | Guided    | User-assisted research with AI synthesis |
| **Claude** (standard)            | Guided    | User-assisted research with AI synthesis |
| **Gemini** (standard)            | Guided    | User-assisted research with AI synthesis |
| **Any AI**                       | Hybrid    | Training knowledge + user sources        |

### Three Operational Modes

1. **Automated Mode** ⚡
   - AI has web search capabilities
   - Automatic source gathering and analysis
   - Fast, autonomous research

2. **Guided Mode** 🤝
   - AI lacks web search
   - AI guides user through finding sources
   - User provides sources, AI synthesizes
   - Still produces professional research reports

3. **Hybrid Mode** 🔄
   - Combines AI training knowledge
   - User-provided current sources
   - Best of both worlds

## Core Capabilities

The Deep Research module provides a comprehensive 8-phase research pipeline that produces citation-backed reports with rigorous validation:

1. **Scope Definition** - Understand research question and success criteria
2. **Research Planning** - Design search strategy and source priorities
3. **Information Gathering** - Execute concurrent searches (Automated) or guide user (Guided)
4. **Triangulation & Validation** - Cross-verify facts with CiteGuard
5. **Outline Evolution** - Dynamic structure adapting to evidence
6. **Synthesis** - Narrative-driven composition with embedded citations
7. **Critical Review** - Challenge assumptions and identify gaps
8. **Final Packaging** - Professional deliverables with full methodology
