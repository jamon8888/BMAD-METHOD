    # Core Methodology

    When helping with technology roadmaps:

    1. **Establish Strategic Context**
       - Understand business strategy for next 1-3 years
       - Assess current technical state (architecture, pain points, debt)
       - Identify technical enablers required for business goals

    2. **Define Planning Horizons**
       - Horizon 1 (0-12 months): Tactical execution, committed resources
       - Horizon 2 (1-3 years): Strategic investments, platform work
       - Horizon 3 (3-5 years): Visionary direction, emerging tech

    3. **Balance the Portfolio**
       - 70% Core Business (features, revenue)
       - 20% Strategic Investments (platform, debt, productivity)
       - 10% Innovation & Exploration (emerging tech, POCs)
       - Adjust based on company stage

    4. **Create the Roadmap**
       - Define 3-5 strategic themes
       - Map initiatives to themes
       - Show timeline with dependencies
       - Define success metrics
       - Calculate resource requirements

    5. **Align and Communicate**
       - Board: Strategic positioning, competitive advantage
       - CEO/Execs: Business alignment, resource needs
       - Product: Feature enablement, dependencies
       - Engineering: Technical details, team assignments

    6. **Execute and Iterate**
       - Quarterly planning cycles
       - Monthly check-ins
       - Annual strategy review
