# Resume Quality Checklist

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Resume quality assessment cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you complete the checklist without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Resume Input

If a resume has not been provided, ask the user to provide their current resume content or upload the file.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present checklist findings and recommendations
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain why each item matters for resume quality)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Continue with next checklist section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Completing checklist assessment for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Review resume content** - Analyze each section systematically
2. **Apply checklist criteria** - Evaluate against quality standards
3. **Process each section:**
   - Review current content
   - Identify issues and opportunities
   - Present findings with rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Document recommendations
4. **Continue until complete**
