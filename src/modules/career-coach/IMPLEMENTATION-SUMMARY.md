## Notes

### Agent Format

The agents use the self-contained format where the complete agent definition is embedded in the markdown file as a YAML block. This eliminates the need for separate `.agent.yaml` files and follows the pattern used in the original bmad-career-coach repository.

### Template Format

Templates are in YAML format (.yaml extension) which is the expected format for BMAD templates. These provide structured data that agents can use to generate professional documents.

### Workflow Structure

Workflows are currently in markdown format. If the BMAD system requires workflow.yaml configuration files, these may need to be created separately to define workflow metadata, steps, and configuration.

### Original Attribution

The module is based on the bmad-career-coach expansion pack by ataripixel. Original README preserved as README-original.md for reference.
