# Create Document

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Document creation cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you complete document creation without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Document Context

If document context has not been provided, ask the user to specify the type of document, purpose, target audience, and key requirements.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present document creation prompts and questions
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain why these questions matter for document quality)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Continue with next document section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Completing document creation for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Define document purpose** - Understand what the document needs to achieve
2. **Identify target audience** - Determine who will read and use the document
3. **Gather content requirements** - Collect all necessary information and materials
4. **Structure the document** - Organize content in a logical, effective format
5. **Create initial draft** - Write the document content
6. **Review and refine** - Improve clarity, accuracy, and effectiveness
7. **Finalize and format** - Complete the document with proper formatting
