# Skills Assessment and Development

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Skills assessment cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you complete skills assessment without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Career Context

If career context has not been provided, ask the user to provide their current role, industry, experience level, and career goals.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present skills assessment prompts and questions
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain why these questions matter for skills development)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Continue with next skills area"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Completing skills assessment for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Inventory current skills** - Identify all skills currently possessed
2. **Assess skill levels** - Evaluate proficiency in each skill area
3. **Identify target skills** - Determine skills needed for career goals
4. **Analyze skill gaps** - Compare current vs. required capabilities
5. **Prioritize development** - Rank skills by importance and urgency
6. **Create development plan** - Design learning and practice strategies
