## OKR Framework

**Objective**: What we want to achieve (qualitative, inspirational, time-bound)
**Key Results**: How we measure success (quantitative, measurable, achievable, relevant)

**Scoring**:

- 0.0-0.3: Not achieved (red)
- 0.4-0.6: Partially achieved (yellow)
- 0.7-1.0: Achieved or exceeded (green)

**Target**: Aim for 0.7 average - if consistently hitting 1.0, OKRs aren't ambitious enough

## OKR Best Practices

**Do**:
✅ Set ambitious but achievable targets (aim for 0.7)
✅ Make Key Results measurable and time-bound
✅ Align with company/business objectives
✅ Review weekly, adjust if needed
✅ Celebrate achievements
✅ Learn from misses without blame

**Don't**:
❌ Set too many OKRs (max 3-5 per team)
❌ Make them BAU tasks (should be ambitious)
❌ Hide behind subjective metrics
❌ Set and forget (need regular check-ins)
❌ Tie directly to performance reviews
❌ Keep impossible OKRs unchanged
