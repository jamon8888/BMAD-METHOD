## Step 3: Prioritize Risks

### Risk Matrix

Plot all risks on this matrix:

```
IMPACT →
   5  |  10  |  15  |  20  |  25
   4  |   8  |  12  |  16  |  20
   3  |   6  |   9  |  12  |  15
   2  |   4  |   6  |   8  |  10
   1  |   2  |   3  |   4  |   5
   ─────────────────────────────
   1     2     3     4     5
          ← PROBABILITY

Risk Zones:
🔴 Red (15-25): Critical - Address immediately
🟡 Yellow (6-14): Important - Plan mitigation within 90 days
🟢 Green (1-5): Low - Monitor and address opportunistically
```

---

### Priority 1: Critical Risks (Score 15-25)

- High probability + Medium impact

**Typical Examples**:

- No disaster recovery plan
- Outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities
- No monitoring on production systems
- Key person dependency

---

### Priority 3: Medium Risks (Score 6-9)

- Medium probability + Medium impact
- High probability + Low impact

**Typical Examples**:

- Manual deployment process
- Limited test coverage
- No automated security scanning
- Technical debt in non-critical systems

---

### Priority 4: Low Risks (Score 1-5)

| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | ----- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| R-001   | No database backups         | Availability | 4           | 5      | 20    | DBA           | In Progress | 2024-02-28          |
| R-002   | SQL injection vulnerability | Security     | 3           | 5      | 15    | Security Team | Not Started | 2024-03-15          |
| R-003   | Key engineer departure risk | Operational  | 3           | 4      | 12    | Eng Manager   | In Progress | 2024-04-30          |
| R-004   | No SOC 2 certification      | Compliance   | 2           | 4      | 8     | CTO           | Planned     | 2024-09-30          |

## Example Risk Assessments

### Example 1: Production Database Has No Backups

**Risk ID**: R-001
**Category**: Availability / Business Continuity
**Identified By**: DevOps Team
**Date**: 2024-01-15

**Description**: Production PostgreSQL database has no automated backup system. If database is corrupted, deleted, or hardware fails, all customer data would be permanently lost.

**Probability**: 4 (Medium-High)

- Database corruption happens
- Human error is common
- No safeguards in place
- Matter of when, not if

**Impact**: 5 (Critical)

- Complete data loss
- Business cannot operate
- Regulatory violations
- Company reputation destroyed
- Potential lawsuits

**Risk Score**: 4 × 5 = 20 (CRITICAL 🔴)

**Existing Controls**: None

**Mitigation Strategy**:

1. Implement automated daily backups with 30-day retention (CTO, Feb 15)
2. Set up point-in-time recovery (PITR) (DevOps Lead, Feb 20)
3. Test backup restoration monthly (DevOps, ongoing)
4. Implement backup monitoring and alerting (DevOps Lead, Feb 25)

**Estimated Cost**: $500/month storage + 40 hours engineering time

**Risk After Mitigation**:

- Probability: 1 (automated system, low failure rate)
- Impact: 2 (can recover with minutes of data loss)
- Residual Risk Score: 2 (LOW 🟢)

**Status**: In Progress (50% complete)

---

### Example 2: No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Risk ID**: R-005
**Category**: Security
**Identified By**: Security Audit
**Date**: 2024-01-20

**Description**: Admin accounts and production systems accessible with password only. No MFA required. Phishing or compromised credentials could give attacker full access.

**Probability**: 3 (Medium)

- Phishing is common
- Password reuse is common
- Credentials leaked in breaches
- Has happened to similar companies

**Impact**: 5 (Critical)

- Complete system compromise possible
- Customer data at risk
- Regulatory violations
- Reputational damage
- Major remediation cost

**Risk Score**: 3 × 5 = 15 (CRITICAL 🔴)

**Existing Controls**:

- Password complexity requirements (partial)
- Rate limiting on login attempts (partial)

**Control Effectiveness**: Partially Effective (passwords alone are insufficient)

**Mitigation Strategy**:

1. Enforce MFA for all admin accounts (Security Team, Feb 28)
2. Enforce MFA for production system access (DevOps, Feb 28)
3. Offer optional MFA for all users (Product Team, Mar 31)
4. Implement MFA for VPN access (IT, Feb 20)

**Estimated Cost**: $5/user/month for MFA service + 60 hours implementation

**Risk After Mitigation**:

- Probability: 1 (MFA significantly reduces successful compromise)
- Impact: 3 (breach still possible but much harder)
- Residual Risk Score: 3 (LOW 🟢)

**Status**: Planned (starting Feb 1)

### Example 3: Single Cloud Provider Dependency

**Risk ID**: R-012
**Category**: Business Continuity
**Identified By**: CTO
**Date**: 2024-01-25

**Description**: Entire infrastructure runs on AWS. If AWS has regional outage or account suspension, business cannot operate. No backup cloud provider.

**Probability**: 2 (Medium-Low)

- AWS outages are rare but happen
- Account suspension unlikely but possible
- Regional failures occur occasionally

**Impact**: 5 (Critical)

- Complete service outage
- No immediate recovery option
- Could last hours or days
- Significant revenue loss

**Risk Score**: 2 × 5 = 10 (HIGH 🟡)

**Existing Controls**:

- Multi-AZ deployment within AWS (partial)
- Good relationship with AWS account team (minimal)

**Control Effectiveness**: Partially Effective (doesn't address AWS-level issues)

**Mitigation Strategy**:

1. Implement multi-region failover within AWS (Q2 2024)
2. Evaluate multi-cloud strategy (Q3 2024)
3. Create runbooks for cloud migration (Q3 2024)
4. Quarterly DR tests including AWS failover scenarios (ongoing)

**Estimated Cost**: $30K/month additional infrastructure + 6 months engineering time

**Risk After Mitigation**:

- Probability: 1 (multi-region significantly reduces risk)
- Impact: 3 (can failover with minimal disruption)
- Residual Risk Score: 3 (LOW 🟢)

**Status**: Planned (roadmapped for Q2)
