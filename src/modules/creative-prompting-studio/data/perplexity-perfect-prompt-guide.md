Always structure prompts to leverage:

- Current information and latest trends

Add to prompts:

- "Highlight any conflicting information from different sources"
- "Prioritize peer-reviewed or authoritative sources"

## Example Transformations

### Vague → Precise

**❌ Vague**:
"Tell me about AI in healthcare"

**✅ Precise**:
"Research the top 3 applications of AI in diagnostic imaging specifically for early cancer detection. Focus on technologies deployed in the last 2 years, including accuracy rates and FDA approval status. Cite all sources and present as a comparison table."

### Too Broad → Well-Scoped

**❌ Too Broad**:
"What are the best marketing strategies?"

**✅ Well-Scoped**:
"For a B2B SaaS startup targeting enterprise customers, identify 5 effective demand generation strategies used successfully in 2024-2025. Include specific tactics, expected ROI ranges, and case studies. Focus on companies with $1-10M ARR. Present as detailed list with examples."

### Unclear Format → Structured Output

**❌ Unclear Format**:
"Find information about sustainable packaging"

**✅ Structured Output**:
"Research sustainable packaging alternatives to plastic for food delivery services. Compare biodegradable, compostable, and reusable options. Present as a table with columns: Material Type, Cost vs. Plastic, Decomposition Time, Consumer Acceptance, Major Adopters. Include citations from industry reports published in 2024-2025."
