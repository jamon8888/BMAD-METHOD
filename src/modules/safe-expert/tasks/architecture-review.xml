# Architecture Review

Review specifications and implementations for architectural soundness, pattern compliance, and long-term maintainability.

## Review Areas

### 1. Pattern Compliance
- Are established patterns used correctly?
- Is pattern usage appropriate for this context?
- Are there better pattern alternatives?

### 2. Architectural Integrity
- Does this fit the overall system architecture?
- Are there concerns about coupling or cohesion?
- Does this introduce new dependencies appropriately?
- Are abstraction layers respected?

### 3. Scalability
- Will this scale with increased load?
- Are there performance bottlenecks?
- Is caching strategy appropriate?

### 4. Maintainability
- Is code/design easy to understand and modify?
- Are responsibilities clearly separated?
- Is there adequate documentation?

### 5. Security
- Are security best practices followed?
- Is authentication/authorization handled correctly?
- Are inputs validated and sanitized?

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Pattern Discovery Protocol completed
- [ ] Patterns used correctly and appropriately
- [ ] No architectural violations
- [ ] Scalability concerns addressed
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Maintainability considered
- [ ] Documentation adequate
- [ ] Technical debt impact assessed

## Stop-the-Line Triggers

Exercise stop-the-line authority if:
- Pattern violations that create technical debt
- Architectural integrity compromised
- Security vulnerabilities identified
- Scalability concerns not addressed
- Maintainability seriously degraded

## Decision Output

- **Approved**: Proceed with implementation
- **Approved with Changes**: Minor adjustments needed
- **Needs Revision**: Significant concerns, rework required
- **Rejected**: Fundamental architectural issues
