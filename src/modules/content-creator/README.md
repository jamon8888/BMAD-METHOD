## 🎯 Best Practices

### Voice Profile Setup

2. **Show Range** - Include different formats (blog, social, newsletter)
3. **Recent Content** - Use recent samples that represent your current voice
4. **Sufficient Length** - Each sample should be 200-300+ words

### Research Sources

1. **Prioritize Your List** - Put most trusted sources at the top
2. **Keep Updated** - Review and update quarterly
3. **Be Specific** - Note why each source is valuable
4. **Include Variety** - Mix news, data, thought leaders, and academic sources

### Content Creation

1. **Start with Research** - Use `*research` before `*write` for best results
2. **Review Voice Examples** - AI will match your voice better with quality examples
3. **Iterate on Quality** - If quality score is low, revise and re-check
4. **Platform-Specific Edits** - Review each platform version before publishing

### Quality Control

1. **Set Realistic Targets** - 70+ quality score is good, 80+ is excellent
