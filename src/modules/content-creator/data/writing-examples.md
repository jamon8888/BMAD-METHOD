## Voice Characteristics to Note

As you add examples, consider including samples that show:

- **Formal vs. Casual:** How formal or casual is your typical tone?
- **Humor Style:** Do you use humor? What kind (dry, playful, sarcastic)?
- **Technical Depth:** How technical or simple is your language?
- **Storytelling:** Do you use personal anecdotes or stories?
- **Perspective:** Do you write in first person (I/we), second person (you), or third person?
- **Sentence Structure:** Short and punchy? Long and flowing? A mix?
- **Vocabulary:** Simple everyday words or more sophisticated language?

The AI will automatically analyze these patterns, but noting them can help you select the best examples.
