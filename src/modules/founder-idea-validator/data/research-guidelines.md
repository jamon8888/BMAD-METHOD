# Research Quality Guidelines

## Core Research Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Research
**Every claim must be backed by sources.**

- All assertions require URL citations
- Prefer data from last 2 years
- Primary sources over secondary
- Multiple sources for major claims

### 2. Multiple Sources Required
**Minimum three sources per major claim.**

- Cross-verify findings across sources
- Look for consensus or disagreement
- Identify outlier claims requiring explanation
- Distinguish facts from opinions

### 3. Source Hierarchy
**Not all sources are equal.**

**Tier 1 (Highest Trust):**
- Company websites (for pricing, features)
- Government data and reports
- Official industry reports
- Academic research papers
- Financial filings and disclosures

**Tier 2 (Medium Trust):**
- Reputable news outlets (WSJ, NYT, Bloomberg)
- Established industry publications
- Well-known industry analysts
- Professional research firms

**Tier 3 (Use with Caution):**
- Forums and Reddit (for demand signals)
- Anonymous reviews
- Blog posts and opinion pieces
- Social media posts
- Unverified user claims

### 4. Transparency Mandate
**State what you know and don't know.**

- Explicitly state confidence levels
- Acknowledge data gaps
- Explain estimation methodologies
- Flag assumptions clearly
- Distinguish facts from inferences

## Confidence Level Framework

### High Confidence
**When to use:**
- 3+ primary sources agree
- Data is recent (< 1 year old)
- Multiple verification methods used
- Minimal assumptions required

**How to communicate:**
"Based on multiple sources including [X, Y, Z], there is strong evidence that..."

### Medium Confidence
**When to use:**
- 2-3 sources available
- Data is 1-2 years old
- Some assumptions required
- Limited verification possible

**How to communicate:**
"Available data suggests... though this should be validated through..."

### Low Confidence
**When to use:**
- Single source or limited sources
- Older data (> 2 years)
- Significant assumptions required
- Conflicting information exists

**How to communicate:**
"Limited data indicates... but confidence is low and testing is required..."

### Unknown / Insufficient Data
**When to use:**
- No reliable sources found
- Data doesn't exist or isn't public
- Too many assumptions required
- Cannot verify claims

**How to communicate:**
"Insufficient data available. Recommend validation through [specific test]..."

## Research Time Allocation

### Market Fit Validation: 10-15 Minutes

**Time breakdown:**
- Competitive research: 4-5 minutes
- Demand signals: 3-4 minutes
- Market sizing: 2-3 minutes
- Pricing analysis: 2-3 minutes

**Focus on:**
- Directional findings, not exhaustive analysis
- Go/no-go decision quality
- Identifying major red flags
- Providing validation next steps

### Distribution Strategy Validation: 10-15 Minutes

**Time breakdown:**
- Competitor channels: 3-4 minutes
- Channel cost research: 4-5 minutes
- CAC benchmarking: 3-4 minutes
- Feasibility assessment: 2-3 minutes

**Focus on:**
- Realistic CAC expectations
- Channel viability assessment
- Alternative channel identification
- Validation experiment design

## Search Strategies

### For Competitive Analysis
- "best [category] tools"
- "[problem] solutions"
- "alternatives to [competitor]"
- "[category] comparison"
- "[industry] software companies"

### For Demand Signals
- Reddit: site:reddit.com "[problem]"
- Forums: "[problem] forum"
- "how to solve [problem]"
- "[problem] alternatives"
- Google Trends: [relevant keywords]

### For Pricing Research
- "[competitor] pricing"
- "[category] cost"
- "how much does [solution] cost"
- "[competitor] pricing page" (add site:)

### For Distribution Channels
- "how [competitor] acquires customers"
- "[industry] customer acquisition"
- "[industry] CAC benchmarks"
- "how to market [category]"
- "[industry] marketing channels"

## Red Flags to Report

### Market Red Flags
- Market saturation with no clear differentiation
- Declining market trends across multiple sources
- Dominant players with 80%+ market share
- Regulatory barriers preventing entry
- Technology shifts making category obsolete

### Pricing Red Flags
- Pricing too low to sustain business
- Market expects free solutions
- Willingness to pay below delivery costs
- Pricing compression trends
- Commoditization indicators

### Distribution Red Flags
- CAC exceeds customer lifetime value
- No obvious customer acquisition channels
- Competitors struggling with CAC
- High customer churn indicates poor fit
- Long sales cycles exceeding runway

## Research Documentation Standards

### For Every Finding

**State the claim:**
"Competitors charge $50-$200/month for comparable SaaS tools"

**Provide sources:**
- [Competitor A Pricing](https://example.com/pricing) - $99/month
- [Competitor B Pricing](https://example.com/pricing) - $149/month
- [Competitor C Pricing](https://example.com/pricing) - $79/month

**State confidence:**
"High confidence - verified from company websites (Tier 1 sources)"

**Note assumptions:**
"Assuming similar feature set; actual comparison depends on specific requirements"

### For Estimates

**Explain methodology:**
"Market size estimated using: (Target users in US: 2M) × (Average spend: $500/year) = $1B TAM"

**State assumptions:**
"Assumes 10% market penetration realistic given distribution constraints"

**Provide confidence level:**
"Medium confidence - based on industry reports and reasonable assumptions"

**Flag validation needs:**
"Validate through customer interviews to confirm spending patterns"

## Common Research Mistakes

### What to Avoid

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Searching only for supporting evidence
- Ignoring contradictory findings
- Cherry-picking favorable data

**Insufficient Verification:**
- Single source for critical claims
- No cross-checking
- Accepting claims at face value

**Outdated Data:**
- Using pre-pandemic data for post-pandemic questions
- Ignoring market shifts
- Assuming old trends continue

**Vague Citations:**
- "Studies show..." without links
- "Industry experts say..." without names
- "It's well known..." without sources

**Unrealistic Assumptions:**
- Assuming perfect conversion rates
- Ignoring competitive responses
- Underestimating execution difficulty

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Start with most reliable sources (Tier 1)
- Cross-verify major claims
- Document search queries used
- Note when data is unavailable
- Provide specific validation steps for uncertainties
- Use recent data (< 2 years when possible)
- Distinguish facts from assumptions

### Don't:
- Rely on single sources for major claims
- Present assumptions as facts
- Use outdated data without noting age
- Make claims without citations
- Cherry-pick favorable data only
- Ignore contradictory evidence

## When Research is Insufficient

If you cannot find sufficient data:

1. **Explicitly state the gap:**
   "Unable to find reliable CAC benchmarks for this specific niche"

2. **Explain why:**
   "This appears to be an emerging category with limited public data"

3. **Suggest validation approach:**
   "Recommend talking to 5-10 target customers to understand willingness to pay and acquisition channels"

4. **Provide analogous data:**
   "Similar B2B SaaS tools show CAC of $500-$2,000, which may serve as rough benchmark"

5. **Set clear success criteria:**
   "Successful validation would show CAC < $1,000 based on industry analogies"

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing research:

- [ ] All major claims have 3+ sources
- [ ] All sources include URLs
- [ ] Confidence levels are stated
- [ ] Assumptions are clearly flagged
- [ ] Data recency is noted
- [ ] Contradictory evidence is addressed
- [ ] Validation steps are provided for uncertainties
- [ ] Red flags are explicitly called out
- [ ] Analogies are noted as such
- [ ] Methodology is explained for estimates

## Remember

Research quality directly impacts validation reliability. Better to say "insufficient data" with recommended validation steps than to make unsupported claims.

**Speed matters, but accuracy matters more.** Take the 10-15 minutes to research properly rather than guessing.
