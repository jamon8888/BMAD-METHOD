# Idea Completeness Checklist

This checklist helps determine whether an idea is sufficiently defined to proceed with rigorous validation across the three pillars (Market Fit, Founder Alignment, Distribution Strategy).

## Purpose

Ideas start fuzzy. That's normal. But to validate properly, you need clear answers to fundamental questions. This checklist identifies what must be clear before proceeding and what can remain uncertain.

## The Five Core Areas

### ✅ WHAT (Idea Description)

**Required Clarity:**

- [ ] Can describe the product/service in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Clear on the form factor (app, service, physical product, platform, etc.)
- [ ] Understand core functionality and key features
- [ ] Scope is manageable (not "we'll build everything")

**Acceptable to Refine:**

- Specific feature details
- Technical implementation approach
- Exact user interface design
- Future iterations and expansions

**Red Flags:**

- Cannot articulate what you're building
- Description changes fundamentally with each explanation
- "We'll figure it out as we go" on core concept
- Scope keeps expanding with no boundaries

**Good Example:**
"A mobile app that helps freelance designers track time across multiple clients and automatically generate invoices. Core features: time tracking, client management, invoice generation with templates, expense tracking."

**Vague Example:**
"A platform for creative professionals to manage their business better."

### ✅ WHO (Target Audience)

**Required Clarity:**

- [ ] Can describe specific target customer beyond demographics
- [ ] Understand their behaviors and pain points
- [ ] Can describe first 100 customers specifically
- [ ] Know where to find these people

**Acceptable to Refine:**

- Secondary customer segments
- International markets
- Adjacent verticals to expand into
- Precise demographic splits

**Red Flags:**

- "Everyone" or "anyone who..." descriptions
- Only demographic info (age, location) without behavioral insights
- Cannot explain why this group needs it specifically
- Don't know where these people gather or how to reach them

**Good Example:**
"Solo freelance designers (graphic, web, UX) who have 3-10 ongoing clients at once, currently using spreadsheets or nothing to track time, losing billable hours and struggling with invoicing. They hang out in r/freelance, Designer News, and local design meetups."

**Vague Example:**
"Small business owners and freelancers."

---

### ✅ WHY (Value Proposition)

**Required Clarity:**

- [ ] Clear problem being solved
- [ ] Understand why current alternatives are insufficient
- [ ] Can state unique value in one sentence
- [ ] Know the "job to be done"

**Acceptable to Refine:**

- Exact messaging and positioning
- All competitive differentiators
- Future value-adds
- Brand and marketing angle

**Red Flags:**

- "It's better" without explaining how
- Just a feature list without clear value
- Cannot articulate why someone would switch from current solution
- Solving problem nobody has

**Good Example:**
"Freelance designers lose 15-20% of billable time because tracking is manual and annoying. Current tools are either too complex (built for agencies) or too simple (basic timers). We're the only tool built specifically for solo designers with automatic invoice generation from tracked time."

**Vague Example:**
"Makes time tracking easier and better."

---

### ✅ HOW-Money (Monetization)

**Required Clarity:**

- [ ] Defined monetization approach (subscription, one-time, usage-based, etc.)
- [ ] Specific pricing amount (or range)
- [ ] Pricing aligns with target audience's expectations
- [ ] Clear reasoning why they'd pay that amount

**Acceptable to Refine:**

- Exact pricing optimization
- Tier structure details
- Future pricing changes
- Payment methods and billing

**Red Flags:**

- "We'll figure out monetization later"
- "Maybe ads or maybe subscription..."
- Pricing far below value delivered
- No understanding of willingness to pay

**Good Example:**
"$19/month subscription. Target customers currently lose $500-1000/month in unbilled time, so paying $19/month to capture that is obvious ROI. Comparable tools charge $30-50/month but do too much; we're simpler and cheaper."

**Vague Example:**
"We'll charge something reasonable, probably subscription-based."

---

### ✅ HOW-Much (Cost Structure)

**Required Clarity:**

- [ ] Estimated cost to deliver per customer
- [ ] Identified main cost drivers
- [ ] Unit economics work (revenue > costs per customer)
- [ ] Understanding of fixed vs. variable costs

**Acceptable to Refine:**

- Exact cost calculations
- Optimization opportunities
- Scale economics
- Detailed financial projections

**Red Flags:**

- No consideration of delivery costs
- "Costs will be minimal" without analysis
- Revenue per customer less than cost per customer
- Ignoring major cost categories

**Good Example:**
"Main costs: hosting ($2/user/month at scale), payment processing (3%), support (estimating 1 hour per 50 users at $25/hour fully loaded). At $19/month, we have $13+ margin per customer to cover overhead and profit."

**Vague Example:**
"Just some hosting costs, very minimal."

## Minimum Viable Definition

**You're ready for validation when you can clearly answer:**

1. **What is it?**
   - Core offering and form factor

2. **Who needs it?**
   - Specific target customer with behavioral description

3. **Why would they want it?**
   - Problem solved and unique value

4. **How will you monetize?**
   - Pricing model and specific amounts

5. **What does it cost to deliver?**
   - Per-customer delivery costs and main drivers

---

## What's Acceptable to Leave Uncertain

### At Refinement Phase:

- Exact feature specifications
- Detailed competitive analysis
- Precise market size
- Specific marketing channels
- Technical architecture details
- Visual design and branding
- Future roadmap beyond MVP

### These Get Addressed in Validation:

- Evidence of market demand
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Distribution channel viability
- Your capability to execute
- Realistic resource requirements

---

## What's NOT Acceptable to Leave Uncertain

### Unacceptable Gaps:

**Cannot articulate what you're building:**

- Too fuzzy to validate
- Need more refinement

**Don't know who needs it:**

- No target = no way to research
- Need customer specificity

**No monetization strategy:**

- Cannot validate unit economics
- Business model required

**Ignored costs entirely:**

- Cannot assess viability
- Economics might not work

**"We'll do everything for everyone":**

- Scope too large
- Need to focus

## Self-Assessment Questions

### WHAT Questions:

1. Can you describe your product in 30 seconds to a stranger?
2. Would two people hear your description and build the same thing?
3. Is the scope small enough to build in 3-6 months?

### WHO Questions:

1. Can you name 10 specific people who fit your target customer?
2. Do you know where these people currently hang out (online/offline)?
3. Can you describe their day-to-day and where your product fits?

### WHY Questions:

1. What do people use today instead of your solution?
2. Why is that insufficient?
3. Would customers agree your solution is better?

### HOW-Money Questions:

1. Have you stated a specific price?
2. Would your target customer see that as expensive or cheap?
3. Is your pricing high enough to build a sustainable business?

### HOW-Much Questions:

1. Can you estimate cost to serve one customer?
2. Is your price higher than your cost to deliver?
3. Do you know your main cost drivers?

## Common Patterns

### Ready for Validation:

- Clear, specific answers to all five areas
- Realistic scope for resources available
- Unit economics make sense
- Can find target customers
- Problem is well-defined

### Needs More Refinement:

- Vague descriptions changing with each telling
- Cannot identify specific customers
- Scope expanding uncontrollably
- No thought about costs or pricing
- Solving hypothetical problems

### Red Flags - Fundamental Issues:

- Solving problem that doesn't exist
- Target customer is "everyone"
- Pricing below cost to deliver
- No clear value proposition
- Cannot articulate core offering

## How to Use This Checklist

### Before Starting Validation:

1. **Review each section** and check off what you can clearly answer
2. **Identify gaps** in your understanding
3. **Spend time refining** areas that are unclear
4. **Work with Lisa** (Validator Analyst) to clarify fuzzy areas
5. **Proceed to validation** once you have clear answers to the five core areas

### If You're Stuck:

**Talk through the idea out loud** - often helps crystallize thinking

**Write a one-pager** - forces clarity on what matters

**Describe to a friend** - their questions reveal gaps

**Ask "why" five times** - gets to core value proposition

**Scope down** - smaller is almost always better

---

## Validation Readiness Levels

### ✅ READY

All five core areas have clear answers. Proceed to validation with confidence.

### ⚠️ ALMOST READY

Most areas clear, but 1-2 need refinement. Spend 30-60 minutes clarifying, then proceed.

### ❌ NOT READY

Multiple fuzzy areas. Work with Validator Analyst (Lisa) to refine before proceeding to full validation.

## Remember

**Fuzzy is normal.** All great ideas started unclear.

**Clarity enables validation.** You can't validate what you can't describe.

**Small and specific beats big and vague.** Scope down to what you can actually build and validate.

**Refinement is not wasted time.** Better to spend 20 minutes clarifying than 20 hours validating the wrong thing.

The goal is not perfection—it's sufficient clarity to make validation meaningful.
