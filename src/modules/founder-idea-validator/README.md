## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npx bmad-method@alpha install
# Select "Founder Idea Validator" module
```

### First Validation

1. **Load Lisa (Validator Analyst)**
   ```
   Load Lisa to refine your idea
   ```

2. **Start Refinement**
   - Type `*start` to begin
   - Answer structured questions about your idea
   - Crystallize concept until validation-ready

3. **Proceed Through Validation**
   - Lisa hands off to Alex (Market Fit)
   - Alex researches demand and competition
   - Marcus assesses your capability
   - Sarah evaluates distribution strategy
   - Jordan synthesizes findings into report

4. **Review Report**
   - Clear recommendation (BUILD/VALIDATE/PIVOT/DON'T)
   - Evidence across all three pillars
   - Specific next steps
   - Action plan with timelines

**Total Time:** 30-45 minutes for complete validation

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: New Product Idea Validation

```
Founder: I have an idea for a mobile app
Lisa: Great! Let's refine it. *start

[5-20 minute conversation clarifying the idea]

Lisa: Your idea is clear. Handing off to Market Fit validation...
Alex: *validate

[10-15 minutes of market research]

Alex: Market shows demand. Moving to Founder Alignment...
Marcus: *validate

[10-15 minutes of capability assessment]

Marcus: You have the skills. Now Distribution Strategy...
Sarah: *validate

[10-15 minutes of distribution research]

Sarah: Channels identified. Generating final report...
Jordan: *generate

[Comprehensive validation report with BUILD NOW/VALIDATE/PIVOT/DON'T recommendation]
```

### Example 2: Service Business Validation

```
Founder: I want to start a consulting practice
Lisa: Let's make sure it's well-defined. *start

[Refines concept, pricing, target market]

Lisa: Ready for validation. Moving to Alex...

[Complete validation flow through all five agents]

Jordan: VALIDATE FIRST ⚠️

Your service has demand and you have expertise, but distribution strategy needs validation. Test these three acquisition channels before committing full-time:
1. LinkedIn outreach (measure 20% response rate)
2. Content marketing (publish weekly, measure inbound interest)
3. Partnership referrals (establish 2-3 partnerships)

Success criteria: 10 qualified leads within 90 days.
```

### Example 3: SaaS Product Validation

```
[After complete validation flow]

Jordan: PIVOT REQUIRED ❌

Your SaaS idea has strong demand signals, but two critical issues:

1. **CAC Unsustainable**: Research shows $500-800 CAC for this market, but your $19/month pricing yields $228 LTV. This doesn't work.

2. **Technical Scope Mismatch**: You estimated 3 months to build but comparable products took 12-18 months with larger teams.

Recommended pivots:
- Increase pricing to $99/month B2B (validates CAC economics)
- OR reduce scope to specific niche (smaller MVP, faster)
- OR find co-founder with technical background

Choose pivot and re-validate.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Getting the Most Value

1. **Be Honest and Specific**: Vague inputs = vague validation. Be specific about your idea, target market, and resources.

2. **Don't Skip Refinement**: Lisa's refinement phase ensures validation is testing the right thing. Don't rush it.

3. **Trust the Research**: Alex and Sarah conduct real research with sources. Trust evidence over optimism.

4. **Face Reality Early**: Better to pivot or stop early than after months of building.

5. **Use Validation Experiments**: If recommendation is VALIDATE FIRST, run the tests before building.

### Best Practices

- **Accept Fuzzy Starts**: All great ideas start unclear. Work with Lisa to crystallize.
- **Provide Context**: The more context you provide, the better the validation.
- **Question Assumptions**: Validators will challenge assumptions - this is valuable.
- **Act on Results**: Don't ignore validation findings. They save you time and money.
- **Iterate**: Most ideas need refinement, not rejection. Pivot and re-validate.

## ❓ FAQ

### How long does validation take?
30-45 minutes for complete validation through all five agents.

### Do I need to talk to all five agents?
Yes for complete validation. But you can use individual agents (e.g., just Alex for market research) if you have specific questions.

### What if I get VALIDATE FIRST?
This is common! It means there's potential but uncertainties. Run the recommended validation experiments (usually 2-4 weeks) then reassess.

### What if I get DON'T PURSUE?
Trust the evidence. Better to know early than after months of building. Extract learnings and move to next idea.

### Can I re-validate after pivoting?
Absolutely! Pivots change assumptions. Re-run validation to test new direction.

### How accurate is the research?
Directional, not exhaustive. Validators spend 10-15 minutes per pillar researching with multiple sources. Sufficient for go/no-go decisions, not replacement for deep market research.

### What industries does this work for?
All. Framework applies to SaaS, e-commerce, services, marketplaces, content, physical products, and more.

### Is this for tech ideas only?
No. Works for any business idea: consulting practices, local services, online courses, apps, physical products, etc.

### Can teams use this together?
Yes! Team dynamics are specifically addressed in Marcus's founder alignment assessment.

### What happens after BUILD NOW?
You get a specific action plan with priorities, metrics to track, and next steps to execute.
