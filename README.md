## AI-Driven Agile Development That Scales From Bug Fixes to Enterprise

**Build More, Architect Dreams** (BMAD) with **42+ specialized AI agents** and **80+ guided workflows** that adapt to your project's complexity—from quick bug fixes to enterprise platforms to content creation, marketing operations, and SAFe development.

> **🚀 v6 is a MASSIVE upgrade from v4!** Complete architectural overhaul, scale-adaptive intelligence, visual workflows, and the powerful BMad Core framework. v4 users: this changes everything. [See what's new →](#whats-new-in-v6)

> **📌 v6 Alpha Status:** Near-beta quality with vastly improved stability. Documentation is being finalized. New videos coming soon to [BMadCode YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BMadCode).

## 🎯 Why BMad Method?

Unlike generic AI coding assistants, BMad Method provides **structured, battle-tested workflows** powered by specialized agents who understand agile development. Each agent has deep domain expertise—from product management to architecture to testing—working together seamlessly.

**✨ Key Benefits:**

- **Scale-Adaptive Intelligence** - Automatically adjusts planning depth from bug fixes to enterprise systems
- **Complete Development Lifecycle** - Analysis → Planning → Architecture → Implementation
- **Specialized Expertise** - 27+ agents with specific roles (PM, Architect, Developer, UX Designer, Content Creator, etc.)
- **Proven Methodologies** - Built on agile best practices with AI amplification
- **Advanced Voice & Style System** - AI content that authentically matches your unique writing style
- **IDE Integration** - Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code

## 🏗️ The Power of BMad Core

**BMad Method** is actually a sophisticated module built on top of **BMad Core** (**C**ollaboration **O**ptimized **R**eflection **E**ngine). This revolutionary architecture means:

- **BMad Core** provides the universal framework for human-AI collaboration
- **BMad Method** leverages Core to deliver agile development workflows
- **BMad Builder** lets YOU create custom modules as powerful as BMad Method itself

With **BMad Builder**, you can architect both simple agents and vastly complex domain-specific modules (legal, medical, finance, education, creative) that will soon be sharable in an **official community marketplace**. Imagine building and sharing your own specialized AI team!

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Install BMad Method

```bash
# Install v6 Alpha (recommended)
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Or stable v4 for production
npx bmad-method install
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Load any agent in your IDE and run:

```
*workflow-init
```

This analyzes your project and recommends the right workflow track.

### 3. Choose Your Track

BMad Method adapts to your needs with three intelligent tracks:

| Track              | Use For                   | Planning                | Time to Start |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| **⚡ Quick Flow**  | Bug fixes, small features | Tech spec only          | < 5 minutes   |
| **📋 BMad Method** | Products, platforms       | PRD + Architecture + UX | < 15 minutes  |
| **🏢 Enterprise**  | Compliance, scale         | Full governance suite   | < 30 minutes  |

> **Not sure?** Run `*workflow-init` and let BMad analyze your project goal.

## 🔄 How It Works: 4-Phase Methodology

BMad Method guides you through a proven development lifecycle:

1. **📊 Analysis** (Optional) - Brainstorm, research, and explore solutions
2. **📝 Planning** - Create PRDs, tech specs, or game design documents
3. **🏗️ Solutioning** - Design architecture, UX, and technical approach
4. **⚡ Implementation** - Story-driven development with continuous validation

Each phase has specialized workflows and agents working together to deliver exceptional results.

## 🤖 Meet Your Team

**12 Specialized Agents** working in concert:

| Development | Architecture   | Product       | Leadership     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Developer   | Architect      | PM            | Scrum Master   |
| UX Designer | Test Architect | Analyst       | BMad Master    |
| Tech Writer | Game Architect | Game Designer | Game Developer |

Each agent brings deep expertise and can be customized to match your team's style.
